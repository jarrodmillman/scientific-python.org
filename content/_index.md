To better coordinate the ecosystem and prepare scientific Python
for the next decade of data science, we will:

1. Create recommendation infrastructure for community-wide policy,
2. Organize a series of developer events to discuss needs,
3. Improve common engineering infrastructure,
4. Write a community vetted strategic plan, and
5. Help the community develop grant proposals.
