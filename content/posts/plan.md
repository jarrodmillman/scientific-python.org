  Scientific Python has emerged as the leading platform for data analysis, but
  its developers have little time to coordinate efforts across projects. Our
  objective is to address that and to prepare scientific Python for the next
  decade of data science.

With an extensive and high-quality ecosystem of libraries, scientific Python
has emerged as the leading platform for data analysis.
This ecosystem is sustained by independent volunteers with separate mailing
lists, websites, roadmaps, documentation, engineering and packaging solutions,
and governance structures.

The developers of these projects have little time to coordinate efforts within
their own projects, let alone focus on strategies for bringing the entire
ecosystem together.
Our objective is to better coordinate the ecosystem and prepare scientific Python
for the next decade of data science.

To this end, we will:

1. Improve common engineering infrastructure,
2. Better coordinate core projects,
3. Write a community vetted strategic plan, and
4. Help the community develop grant proposals.

Since the grant was written pre-COVID-19, we are currently rethinking our
original approach, recruiting the advisory council, and shaping the
initial stage of the grant.
